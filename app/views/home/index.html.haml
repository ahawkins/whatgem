    # How it Works
    WhatGem is a gem ranking website. It rates gems on various metrics.
    Gems get points for having tests, examples, documenation, votes, and comments.
    Gems can also be voted up or down. The more times a gem is a dependency
    for other gems, the higher ranking it has. The autor also impacts the rating
    as well. Sign in with your github acount to comment and vote on gems!
