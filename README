Currently the gems are ranked by these factors:

1. Unit tests present? (Come from inspecting the Github Repo using their API)'
2. Online Documentation Available (Come from the Gemcutter API)
3. Cucumber features present (Using github api)
4. Examples present (Using github api)
5. License present (Using github api)
6. Closed issue percentage
7. Merged pull request percentage
8. Up-vote percentage

I want to expand to these "Extra points"
1. Author(s) have twitter feeds?
2. Gem has mailing list?
3. Gem has IRC-chan
4. Gem has been mentioned at conferences?
5. Gem has screen casts?
6. Gem has rubygem-testers.org entry (currently just linking)
7. This hard to gauge by "author rep"
8. Commenting (counts as an upvote....gems with more comments usually more well received than others)
9. User posted links/resources. Counts as +1 for the gem. Gems with more resources are better than others.

Using the currently described ranking, cucumber comes out on top with a rating of ~93%. Sounds right to me because cucumber is very library.
